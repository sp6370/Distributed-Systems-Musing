Panel 1:

I TRY NOT TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FOR ADMITTING THEY DON'T KNOW THINGS.

BECAUSE FOR EACH THING "EVERYONE KNOWS" BY THE TIME THEY'RE ADULTS, EVERY DAY THERE ARE, ON AVERAGE, 10,000 PEOPLE IN THE US HEARING ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

FRACTION WHO HAVE HEARD OF IT AT BIRTH = 0%

FRACTION WHO HAVE HEARD OF IT BY 30 ≈ 100%

US BIRTH RATE ≈ 4,000,000/year

NUMBER HEARING ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME ≈ 10,000/day

Panel 2:

IF I MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE, I TRAIN THEM NOT TO TELL ME WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE MOMENTS. AND I MISS OUT ON THE FUN.

"DIET COKE AND MENTOS THING"? WHAT'S THAT?

OH MAN! COME ON, WE'RE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE.

WHY?

YOU'RE ONE OF TODAY'S LUCKY 10,000.
